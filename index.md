Welcome!


I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at [Stanford University](https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/). My research interests span international political economy, international institutions, and law, with a focus on the politics of global capitalism. I study how the growth of private authority influences domestic legal development and the power of countries to regulate foreign commerce. I also have ongoing research projects in related areas including transnational anti-corruption efforts and global competition law. I hold a PhD in Government from Cornell University and I have previously held postdoctoral positions at Yale University and Harvard University.
